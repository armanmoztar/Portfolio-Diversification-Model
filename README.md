# Portfolio Diversification Model

## Overview
This project aims to implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms for financial data analysis and forecasting. **Time series** stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance API and analyzed using the 
**Upper Confidence Bound** (UCB) algorithm. The confidence interval is displayed in the Angular frontend. **Forecasting** functionality is in development, using **Vector Auto Regression** (VAR) and Keras 
**Long Short-Term Memory** (LSTM) models.

## Features
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: Reinforcement Learning algorithm to analyze financial data and create recommendations based on risk tolerance and historical performance.
- **Angular Frontend**: Interactive user interface to search for stocks and display the confidence bounds.
- **VAR Forecasting**: Utilizes the Vector Auto Regression model to forecast financial trends.
- **Keras LSTM Forecasting**: Incorporates the Long Short-Term Memory model from Keras for time series forecasting.

## Demo
A demo of the application is yet to be deployed.
